# Forked Project: TestDisk 7.1

## Overview

This project is a fork of **TestDisk 7.1**, a data recovery utility originally developed by **Christophe GRENIER** and maintained by CGSecurity. The original TestDisk is a powerful tool for recovering lost partitions and making non-booting disks bootable again. It was designed to work with a wide variety of filesystems and storage devices.

## Why This Fork?

Our fork of TestDisk aims to build upon the original utility by incorporating additional features and improvements tailored to the specific needs of our user base. This version maintains the robust data recovery functionalities of TestDisk while introducing enhancements to the user interface, compatibility, and performance.

## Key Differences from the Original TestDisk

- **User Interface Improvements:** Enhancements have been made to ensure better usability across various terminal sizes and environments.

## Installation

To install this forked version of TestDisk:

1. Clone the repository:

2. Navigate to the directory and compile:

   make
   ```
3. Run the utility:

## Usage
